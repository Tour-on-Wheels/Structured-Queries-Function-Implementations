**Parameters for test cases**  
PAGE_SIZE = 28
BUFFRE_SIZE = 40   

In final evaluation we can change these parameters to test your code, also make sure your code work for very large testcases too.  
 
 ## TC_search

**sorted_input** - Binary file containing Sorted integers   
**query_search.txt** - File containing integers which need to search in sorted_input file   
**output_Search.txt** - Contain search output  

 
 ## TC_insert  
 Test case for insertion   
 **sorted_input** - Binary file containing Sorted integers  
 **query_insert.txt** - File containing integers which need to insert in sorted_input file
